Inbound client traffic redirects through an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to an Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) cluster, which is the core service for all Superset modules, including the core business framework, cache, database, and message queue. Each module runs separately as a single Amazon ECS service and relaunches if any of your tasks fail. Discovery of all ECS services is handled by AWS Cloud Map through an internal private DNS, and outbound traffic, such as a software updates, connect through network address translation (NAT) gateways. Persistent data includes queried data, and system metadata is stored in an Elastic File System, in consideration of security and cost.

Compared to the community Apache version, Superset provides the following:

* Core modules (that is, Superset, Cache, and Database) that are highly available.
* Business data (that is, metadata, query data, and interactive data) persistence.
* Platform elasticity and scalability. Users do not need to maintain the infrastructure and associated resource scheduling.
* To display existing data, preinstalled SQL, PostgreSQL, Redshift, Athena, and Clickhouse data-source driver.
* For future trend predictios, preinstalled timing prediction algorithm that are based on imported data.
* Visual Kanban for real-time service metrics and comprehensive application monitoring.
